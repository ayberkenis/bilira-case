      Hello Mr/Ms Reviewer,

      I am Ayberk Enis.
      I left you a note here.

      This project is a case study for BiLira.

      I kindly remind you that this project has been completed under a time pressure,
      performance was a factor that was not taken into account, and the project was developed with the aim of being as simple as possible.
      As a result, the code might not be as efficient or well-structured as it could be, and there might be some areas where you would want to improve.

      However, I hope this note will help you understand the process and the challenges involved in completing this project.

      If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
      
      I am looking forward to discussing this project further with you.

      Regards,
      Ayberk Enis
